### What is this repository for? ###

This is a project for learning about android, kotlin, firebase and also trying to implement it with a clean architecture and MVP as patter. I have developed it in "agus" branch, because this is a common project for learning between me and 2 friends. Master branch was the common starter point but is not updated because each of us has developed it in our own way.
